    "Hi my name is, what My name is, who My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi my name is, huh My name is, what My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Excuse me! Can I have the attention of the class for one second Hi kids, do you like violence Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is My brain's dead weight I'm trying to get my head straight But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate And Dr. Dre said Slim Shady, you a basehead! Uh-uhhh! So why's your face red Man, you wasted! Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast Come here, slut Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dog! I don't give a fuck God sent me to piss the world off My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five I smacked him in his face with an eraser Chased him with a stapler Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup Extraterrestrial running over pedestrians In a spaceship while they're screaming at me Let's just be friends! 99 percent of my life I was lied to I just found out my mom does more dope than I do Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her You know you blew up when the women rush your stands And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph So I signed it: Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate! I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive Am I coming or going I can barely decide I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive All my life I was very deprived I ain't had a woman in years My palms too hairy to hide Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom You ain't got no tits! I lay awake and strap myself in the bed Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head I'm steaming mad And by the way, when you see my dad Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had ",
    "Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart and suddenly his conscience comes into play [Verse 1: Dr. Dre] Alright stop, now before you walk in the door Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer You better think of the consequence (Who are you) I'm your mothafuckin' conscience! (That's nonsense) Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you Think about it before you walk in the door first Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns! Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich Why you give a fuck if she dies Are you that bitch Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids Man don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!) Not over this shit drop the biscuit (I will!) (You know what Dre, I don't like yo attitude)  Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek Smearing her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe (Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair) Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare 'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there (Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids) No but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest! (Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail) Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man (What the fuck) Alright, calm down, relax, start breathing (Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheating While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!) Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit (What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick) Alright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady But think about the baby before you get all crazy Okay, thought about it Still wanna stab her Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her That's what I did, be smart don't be a retard You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes (What you say) What's wrong Didn't think I'd remember (I'ma kill you mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went Been there, done that, aw fuck it, what am I saying Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at ",
    "[Doctor] Scalpel [Nurse] Here [Doctor] Sponge [Nurse] Here [Doctor] Wait.. he's convulsing, he's convulsing [Nurse] Ah [Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him [Nurse] Oh my! Oh my God! [Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him [Nurse] Oh my God! These are the results of a thousand electric volts A neck with bolts Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse! A kid who refused to respect adults Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose A corny looking White boy Scrawny and always ornery Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies picking on me And I might snap, one day just like that I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack My first day in junior high this kid said It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die! I looked at my watch it was 1:20 I already gave you my lunch money What more do you want from me He said, don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse My palms were sweaty And I started to shake at first Something told me, try to fake a stomach ache, it works I screamed, Oww, my appendix feels like they could burst! Teacher, teacher quick I need a naked nurse What's the matter I don't know, my leg, it hurts! Leg I thought you said it was your tummy Oh I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework But don't you wanna give me after school detention Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mma let him Brain damage Ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was going But everywhere I go they keep playing my song Way before my baby daughter Hailey I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes So every day he'd shove me in the lockers One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissing And had me in the position to beat me into submission He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose Soaked my clothes in blood Grabbed me and choked my throat I tried to plead and tell him We shouldn't beef But he just wouldn't leave He kept choking me and I couldn't breathe He looked at me and said, You gonna die, honky! The principal walked in, and started helping him stomp me I made them think they beat me to death Holding my breath for like five minutes before they finally left Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools This is for every time you took my orange juice Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt I'm gettin you back bully Now once and for good I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could And beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood Knocked him down Stood on his chest with one foot Made it home, later that same day Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray I couldn't even see what I was trying to read I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed My mother started screaming, What are you on, drugs Look at you, you're getting blood all over my rug! Sorry! She beat me over the head with the remote control Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull I picked it up and screamed Look bitch, what have you done! Oh my God, I'm sorry son! Shut up you cunt I said fuck it Took it and stuck it back up in my head Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck ",

    "[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)] I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts You know, there's a story behind that there saloon Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen Got murdered in cold-blood That old saloon there was their little home away from home They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern And on a quiet night You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9 [Verse 1: Eminem] I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead Told him each one of his boys is dead I asked him to come to the dark side He made a choice and said Who hard Yo I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which one'll swerve first Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds That of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto Dismissal, I'm not a fair man Disgraced the race of an atheist Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nations Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people I'm Evil, and he's Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law cause I don't agree with police either (Shit, me neither) We ain't eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain (He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off Cause I can't find a decent vein The disaster with dreads I'm bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter Cause I serve any stranger with money While slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough To cast a avalanche I'm the one who burned your house down And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe Against peaceful see you in hell for the sequel Wall Street See you in hell for the sequel (bye-bye) Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time) Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that ",
